                'taskname':'Uncovered Junction Box',
                'taskanswer':'Spend a few cents to buy a new cover and install it with the screws provided.'
                },
            {
                'taskname':'Too Few Oulets',
                'taskanswer':'Nowadays most of the houses have extension cords and power strips to rely heavily on them. If you don’t use heavy load extension cords like 14-gauge or thicker the risk will be minimal. Thus it is advisable to use more outlets with the help of an electrician.'
                },
            {
                'taskname':'No GFCIs',
                'taskanswer':'Replace old receptacles with GFCIs (about $12 each). This is a simple job that many homeowners do themselves. Electricians charge about $20 per outlet. (There will likely be a minimum job charge.) Note: As an alternative, GFCI breakers ($25) can be installed on the main panel. But then every time one trips, you have to go down to the basement to reset it.'

                'taskname':'Aluminum Wiring',
                'taskanswer':'It has a high danger level as aluminum was used as a cheap substitute for copper in earlier days and is no longer a safe option. This is because corrosion takes place when aluminum is in contact with copper and when the connections loosen, it leads to fires. The solution for this issue is retrofitting a dielectric wire nut for aluminum wire to copper connection in case of light fixtures. This helps in stopping corrosion due to the grease in the nuts.'
                },
            {
                'taskname':'Backstabbed Wires',
                'taskanswer':'The pushed wires at the back can be loose for new switches than those anchored around screw terminals. This is not a code violation as it is allowed for new constructions too. The risk occurs only when the loose wires are worst in case otherwise it stops the switch from working. Check if your wires are backstabbed, if so, release it and fix them to the respective screw terminals on the receptacle.'
                },

                'taskanswer':'When other high power consuming items are used before you plug in microwave or hairdryers there is a chance to get it tripped. Tripping is actually a sign that your home is protected. Just check what causes tripping and try using a low setting and also usage can be limited to a single circuit too.'
                },
            {
                'taskname':'Electric shocks',
                'taskanswer':'When the electricity is not properly used, it results in electrical shocks with a nasty experience. The chances of such electrical problems in old homes were quite high because the circuits fitted during older days. An electric shock happens when you switch on or off a device. The issue can either be with the appliance or the wiring. To check the issue, you can test with another device. But to be on the safer side, just talk with your electrician to resolve the issues.'

            {
                'taskname':'Overcircuited panel',
                'taskanswer':'It is a code violation to place tandem breakers in one slot rather than too many single-pole breakers. The difference between double-pole breakers and tandem breakers are that the latter one doesn’t take up two slots in a single circuit. The danger level will be minimal. This problem can be resolved by adding a sub-panel with extra slots or replacing the existing panel with a bigger model.'

            {
                'taskname':'Circuit breaker tripping frequently',
                'taskanswer':'High wattage items like microwaves and hairdryers can trip circuit breakers, particularly when other power consuming items are used on the same source. A circuit breaker is designed to protect you and your home, so when it does trip, that’s a sign it’s doing its job. Look at what you were using when it tripped. If it was a hair dryer, try using the low setting. Alternatively, limit the electrical usage on a single circuit while high watt devices are in use.'
                },
            {
                'taskname':'Circuit overloading',
                'taskanswer':'Sometimes your light fixture has a bulb or other fitting with high watts than the designed fixture. This is a code violation and the risk level is quite high. The high heat from the bulb can melt the socket and insulation present in wires of the fixture. This results in sparks from one wire to another and causes electrical fires. Even after the bulb is removed, the socket and wires will still be under damage. It is always better to fit a bulb or any other fittings by staying within the wattage. If the fixtures are not marked with wattage, it is advisable to use a 60-watt bulb or even smaller ones.'
